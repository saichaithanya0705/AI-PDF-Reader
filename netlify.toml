# Notes for Netlify Deployment:
# 1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/
# 2. Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
# 3. Connect to GitHub and select your repository
# 4. Netlify will auto-detect this config file
# 5. Set environment variables in Site settings → Environment variables
# 6. Deploy!

# Important:
# - Update frontend API URLs to point to Render backend
# - Currently hardcoded to http://localhost:8080
# - Search for "localhost:8080" in frontend code and replace with Render URL
